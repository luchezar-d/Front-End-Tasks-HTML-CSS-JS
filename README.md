First of all i want to apologise because i can't use all of my time given to finish the tasks because i have to travel from 19th
to 21st and this is the deadline for me.I've done all i can for the time i had.I was hoping to make the page responsive with media
queries but i didn't have the time. I finished 5 out of 8 javascript tasks.And i couldn't start on the react part.I probably could have done more.
